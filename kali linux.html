<p>If you are interested in penetration testing or cybersecurity stuff you need some specific</b>
 tools to perform some tasks which come pre-installed and settled up in Kali Linux so you may</b>
 directly use them without doing any configuration. Or in case if one wants to check the vulnerabilities </b>
on a website or want to know security-related bugs in any application then it is great to go with Kali Linux.</b> 
Many people think that Kali is a tool for hacking or cracking social accounts or web servers. This</b>
is one of the biggest myths about Kali Linux. Kali Linux is just another Debian distribution with a </b>
bunch of networking and security tools. It is a weapon to train or defend yourself not to attack anyone. </b>
Kali Linux was designed mainly for professionals. It is for those who want to get their hands in Penetration Testing,
</b> Cyber Security, or Ethical Hacking. It is a powerful tool and in case, not used properly, it may lead to losses even.</b>
